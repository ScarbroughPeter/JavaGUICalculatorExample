# Java GUI Calculator Example

I practiced Java as a hobby for awhile and wanted to cap off what I had learned with a few simple projects. In this project, I worked to reproduce a simple GUI calculator. The current calculator simply includes addition and subtraction using integers. It can be operated with buttons or keyboard input.

Although it would be straight-forward to extend functionality to include floats and thereby include multiplication and division, I declined to pursue that further. This is because I had decided the remaining work was going to be simply tedious and no longer in the spirit of writing an example GUI in Java. I might revisit someday to finish it up though.

The GUI was coded using the GUI tools in the NetBeans IDLE.

I've included relevant source files and the final distribution (.jar) file for the application. If Java is installed on one's machine they may simple download the jar file and run it like a regular application to test it for themselves.
